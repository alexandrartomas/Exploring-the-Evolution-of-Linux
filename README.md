## [Exploring the Evolution of Linux]
<div>
 <p>
  Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git store rich
evolution information about a software project. In this project, 
you'll be challenged to read in, clean up and visualize a real world
Git repository dataset of the Linux kernel. With almost 700k commits and 
thousands of contributors (find out the exact number in this project ;-) )
there are some little data cleaning and wrangling challenges that you'll
encounter. But you'll also gain insights about the development activities
over the last 13 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  For this Project, you need to be familiar with Pandas
  <code>
   DataFrame
  </code>
  s,
especially the
  <code>
   read_csv
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   groupby
  </code>
  functions, as well as working with time series data.
