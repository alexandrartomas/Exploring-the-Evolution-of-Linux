## Exploring the Evolution of Linux
<div>
 <p>
  Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git store rich
evolution information about a software project. In this project, 
you'll be challenged to read in, clean up and visualize a real world
Git repository dataset of the Linux kernel. With almost 700k commits and 
thousands of contributors (find out the exact number in this project ;-) )
there are some little data cleaning and wrangling challenges that you'll
encounter. But you'll also gain insights about the development activities
over the last 13 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  For this Project, you need to be familiar with Pandas
  <code>
   DataFrame
  </code>
  s,
especially the
  <code>
   read_csv
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   groupby
  </code>
  functions, as well as working with time series data.

## Generating Keywords for Google Ads
<div>
 <p>
  You work for a digital marketing agency, which is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. 
You are tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. With your 
Python skills, you will efficiently create these keywords!
 </p>
 <p>
  The most important task in structuring a search engine marketing account is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages. Having figured that out is a big part of the account setup and makes the life of the account manager much easier.
